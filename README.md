# Anoma Interactive Journey (TR/EN)

▫️The user is welcomed by a “story site.”
▫️With TR/EN language support, it explains the fundamentals of Anoma:
- Intent creation → the user only states their goal.   
- Solver network → solvers find the most optimal path.  
- Settlement → the transaction is completed across chains. - Roadmap & Namada relation → future plans are explained.
